Description: gRPC service for managing Firecracker microVMs
 Firecracker Agent is a high-performance gRPC service that provides
 programmatic control over Firecracker microVMs. It manages the complete
 VM lifecycle including:
 .
  * VM creation, starting, stopping, and deletion
  * Network configuration (TAP devices and bridge setup)
  * Storage management with copy-on-write overlay support
  * Process lifecycle management
  * Health monitoring and metrics
 .
 The agent communicates with Firecracker via Unix sockets and exposes
 a gRPC API for remote management, making it ideal for orchestration
 systems and cloud platforms.
